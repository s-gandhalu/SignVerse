- Mute person signs
- System translates to text/speech
- Hearing person understands

### 2. Mute ↔ Blind Communication
- Mute person signs
- System translates to text
- Text-to-Speech reads aloud
- Blind person hears the message

### 3. Learning Sign Language
- Use Text-to-Sign converter
- Enter words to learn
- Get detailed instructions
- Practice with live detection feedback

### 4. Assistive Communication
- Real-time translation in meetings
- Educational settings
- Public services (hospitals, government offices)
- Emergency communication

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Adjust Detection Sensitivity

**In the UI:**
- Use the "Confidence" slider (left sidebar)
- Lower = more detections (may include false positives)
- Higher = fewer detections (more accurate)

**In the Code (app.py):**
```python
BUFFER_SIZE = 8              # Reduce for faster response
STABILITY_THRESHOLD = 6      # Lower for quicker confirmation
MIN_CONFIDENCE = 0.45        # Adjust accuracy threshold
```

### Adjust Processing Speed

**In index.html:**
```javascript
processingInterval = setInterval(processFrame, 100);
// Change 100 to:
// - 50 for faster processing (higher CPU)
// - 150 for slower processing (lower CPU)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Model Not Loading
```
❌ Error loading model: weights_only...
```
**Solution**: The app automatically patches this. If issues persist:
```bash
export TORCH_FORCE_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD=0
```

### Camera Not Working
```
❌ Camera access denied
```
**Solutions**:
- Check browser permissions
- Ensure no other app is using the camera
- Try a different browser (Chrome recommended)

### Slow Detection
**Causes**:
- Low-end hardware
- High confidence threshold
- Too many background objects

**Solutions**:
1. Lower confidence slider
2. Use better lighting
3. Plain background
4. Close other applications

### Detection Too Sensitive
**Solutions**:
1. Increase confidence slider
2. Hold gestures more steady
3. Adjust `STABILITY_THRESHOLD` in code
